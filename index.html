### Main research themes

*Multi-sensor scene understanding and forecasting* — Driving monitoring and automatization relies first on a variety of sensors (cameras, radars, laser scanners) that deliver complementary information on the surroundings of a vehicle and on its cabin. Exploiting at best the outputs of each of these sensors at any instant is fundamental to understand the complex environment of the vehicle and to anticipate its evolution in the next seconds. To this end, we explore various machine learning approaches where sensors are considered either in isolation or collectively. 

*Data/annotation-efficient learning* — Collecting diverse enough real data, and annotating it precisely, is complex, costly, time-consuming and doomed insufficient for complex open-world applications. To reduce dramatically these needs, we explore various alternatives to full supervision, in particular for perception tasks: self-supervised representation learning for images and point clouds, visual object detection with no or weak supervision only, unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of images and point clouds, for instance. We also investigate training with fully-synthetic or generatively-augmented data.  

*Dependable models* — When the unexpected happens, when the weather badly degrades, when a sensor gets blocked, embedded safety-critical models should continue working or, at least, diagnose the situation to react accordingly, e.g., by calling an alternative system or human oversight. With this in mind, we investigate ways to assess and improve the robustness of neural nets to perturbations, corner cases and various distribution shifts. Making their inner workings more interpretable, by design or in a post-hoc way, is also an important and challenging venue that we explore towards more trust-worthy models.
